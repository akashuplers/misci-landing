            We understand that you may want to cancel the subscription due to
            some unavoidable circumstances on your side, but you need to
            understand that once purchase is completed the system gets into
            action to create the account and allocate resources, so the early we
            know about the cancellation the better. Also we would like to know
            the reason of cancellation and feedback about Lille.ai if any.

          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Cancellations made within 7 days of the purchase date will receive a
            70% refund. Your subscription will be active till one month from the
            day of the purchase.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            And in this case if your cancellation is because of some very
            unavoidable circumstances then we may offer you a discount for the
            future subscription after getting to know the reasons.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Once the cancellation request is received and acknowledged the
            refund will be processed and time of refund completion will depend
            on the payment mode used by you. For the payments made by debit or
            credit cards it normally takes 7 to 10 days for the amount to reach
            the customer banks.
