About half the genes found in bananas are also found in humans.",
                    "Thousands of years ago, acuminata and balbisiana crossed fertilized, producing natural hybrids. Over time, random mutations produced plants with seedless fruit that were more edible than seed-filled varieties, so people ate them and cultivated them.",
                    "Bananas may be the world’s oldest cultivated crop. There is evidence that bananas were cultivated in the highlands of New Guinea at least 7,000 years ago and that Musa varieties were being bred and grown in the Mekong Delta area of Southeast Asia as long as 10,000 years ago.",
                    "In the first or second millennium B.C., Arab traders carried banana suckers from Southeast Asia back home and introduced the fruit to the Middle East and the east coast of Africa. Swahili people from the coast of Africa traded the fruit with Bantu people from the interior of Africa, and they carried the fruit to western Africa. The introduction of the banana to Africa occurred so long ago that areas of Uganda and the Congo basin have become secondary centers of genetic diversity.",
                    "Bananas were discovered by the Portuguese on the Atlantic coast of Africa. They cultivated the fruit on the Canary Islands. From there, it was introduced to the Americas by Spanish missionaries.",

Banana trade dispute finally ended in 2010 with a deal between the European Union and Latin America, and was approved by African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the United States.

At this point, the Native Americans were still hunting buffalo on the vast, lush grasslands of the prairie. And, unlike back in Europe, there was plenty of space to raise cattle and dairy cows, in the huge tracts of pastureland.",

Cereal crops allowed agricultural societies to sustain much larger populations than possible, leading to the rise of civilized states.",

Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer as a starter. People that didn’t drink beer but had wine used a paste composed of grape must or wheat bran steeped in wine.",

Even then, in ancient times, there was a variety of bread: griddle cakes, honey-and-oil bread, mushroom-shaped loaves covered in poppy seeds, and the military specialty of rolls baked on a spit.",

It used the intense mechanical working of dough to reduce the fermentation period. Process shortened the time to produce a loaf but at the expense of taste and nutrition."

In the East, cabbage is used since the 4,000 BC and was cultivated in North China. These variants were nonheading cabbages and were domesticated by Celts of central and western Europe.",

Despite chocolate’s importance in Mayan culture, it wasn’t reserved for the wealthy and powerful, but was readily available to almost everyone. In many Mayan households, chocolate was enjoyed with every meal. Mayan chocolate was thick and frothy and often combined with chili peppers, honey or water.",

Like the Maya, they enjoyed the caffeinated kick of hot or cold, spiced chocolate beverages in ornate containers, but they also used cacao beans as currency to buy food and other goods. In Aztec culture, cacao beans were considered more valuable than gold.",

One story says Christopher Columbus discovered cacao beans after intercepting a trade ship on a journey to America and brought the beans back to Spain with him in 1502.",
                    "No matter how chocolate got to Spain, by the late 1500s it was a much-loved indulgence by the Spanish court, and Spain began importing chocolate in 1585. As other European countries such as Italy and France visited parts of Central America, they also learned about cacao and brought chocolate back to their respective countries.",

                    "When chocolate first came on the scene in Europe, it was a luxury only the rich could enjoy. But in 1828, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten discovered a way to treat cacao beans with alkaline salts to make a powdered chocolate that was easier to mix with water.",
                    "For much of the 19th century, chocolate was enjoyed as a beverage; milk was often added instead of water. In 1847, British chocolatier J.S. Fry and Sons created the first chocolate bar molded from a paste made of sugar, chocolate liquor and cocoa butter.",

                    "The Cranberry Story The history of cranberries is older than the recorded history of America. Long before the first European settlers arrived, the Indians not only ate cranberries, but also used them as medicine and clothing dye. The Indians called the red berries 'sasemineash' and also 'pakimintzen.'",
                    "The Pilgrims gave this fruit the name 'crane berry' because its pink blossom reminded them of the head of a crane, a large wading bird. Over the years its name has been shortened to cranberry.",
                    "The Cranberry (genus Vaccinium) is native to the swamps and bogs of northeastern North America. It belongs to the Heath, or Heather family (Ericaceae), which is a very widespread family of about 125 genera and about 3500 species.",
                    "The cranberry plant is described as a low-growing, woody perennial with small, oval leaves borne on fine, vine-like shoots. Horizontal stems, or runners, grow along the soil surface, rooting at intervals to form a dense mat.",
                    "The American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) grows wild from the mountains of Georgia to the Canadian Maritimes, and as far west as Minnesota. It has been cultivated in the Cape Cod area since the early 1800s and was an active industry in Maine during much of the last century.",
                    "The cultivated cranberry industry then spread to New Jersey by the 1830s, Wisconsin by the 1850s, and the Pacific Northwest by the 1880s.",
                    "The first actual cultivation of the cranberry is attributed to Henry Hall, a Revolutionary War veteran who lived in North Dennis, MA on Cape Cod. Hall was the captain of a sailing vessel, and as he passed his property on Cape Cod Bay, he noted how the best producing and most vigorously growing cranberry vines near his home were those that received regular dune sand driven by the northeast winds.",
                    "Initially Boston became the major marketing center for cranberries shipped to markets in the United States and Europe. For such long distance shipping, cranberries were packed in water in barrels that held 100 pounds of the tart fruits. Cranberries in barrels were consumed by the sailors during their voyages to prevent scurvy, in the same way that limes were used by the British sailors.",
                    "The barrel (100 pounds) became the standard measure of production for cranberries, and is still used today. This measurement is unique to the cranberry.",
                    "The native Wampanoag people have been cultivating these berries and enjoying them fresh, cooked, and dried for more than 12,000 years. Fast forward to the 1600s and the arrival of Europeans, who noticed the North American cranberries resembled another species of cranberry native to boggy England. It wasn’t until almost 200 years later, in 1816, that the settlers started cultivating the berries for commercial use."

The Wampanoag combined the fresh berries with dried meat and fat for flavor and preservation. They then cooked the mixture until it became smooth and spoonable,and then served it like porridge."

As time went by, their manufacturing capabilities expanded, and in 1st millennia BC they started trading with Middle Eastern civilization and Europe.",
                    "In addition to eating, cucumbers were also widely used as a source of several medicinal remedies (both cultivated and wild cucumbers of cucumbers were used for creation of over various 40 remedies). Cucumbers treated everything from bad eyesight, scared mices, cured scorpion bites, and carried around wastes by wives who wished to have children.",
                    "Age of Discovery proved to be a very important factor of spreading cucumber all across the word. Christopher Columbus brought cucumbers to Haiti in 1494 where they were grown by Spanish settlers and distributed further across New World. During 16th century, European trappers in North America introduced cucumbers to the native Indians in the region of Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains.",
                    "During 18th century, expansion of cucumbers across North America suddenly stopped when several medicinal journals started reporting that cucumbers and all similar vegetables that were not cooked represented serious health risk. Discouraged by those misconceptions, cucumber use plummeted across the continent, which was reversed only in 19th century."

Domestication did not happen suddenly, but was a slow process, starting with the hunting of wild goats. Gradually, communities started herding their prey, then managing and breeding them.",
                    "Judging by early signs of domestication, such as bones from the slaughter of male young, this started around 10,500 years ago in Anatolia (Turkey) and the Zagros Mountains (Iran). Neolithic sites reveal how the practices of agriculture and pastoralism spread around the region.",

The division between east and west populations appears to have occurred thousands of years before the domestication of goats, as wild animals spread to new locations.",

Colonists scattered in groups along the coast and, little by little, locals chose to adopt their farming practices. Farming communities in Greece and Bulgaria started up by around 6500 years ago. Goats and farming spread northwards along the Danube to reach western Europe and Scandinavia by 4000–5000 years ago. A Mediterranean route brought goats to Italy and Spain around 7500 years ago.",

The fruit comes in a large variety of shapes, selected for by their human users. The bottle gourd is primarily grown for its fruit, which when dried forms a woody hollow vessel that is suitable for containing water and food, for fishing floats, for musical instruments and for clothing, among other things.",

Two subspecies, likely representing two separate domestication events, have been identified: Lagenaria siceraria spp. siceraria (in Africa, domesticated some 4,000 years ago) and L. s. spp. asiatica (Asia, domesticated at least 10,000 years ago.",

If true, then the Asian form of the bottle gourd was domesticated at least a couple of thousand years before that. Evidence of that has not been discovered, although domestic bottle gourds from several Jomon period sites on Japan have early dates."

                    "Honey is produced by honeybees (genus Apis). These insects forage throughout the day, visiting flowers and collecting nectar. They later return to their hives and deposit this nectar in waxy honeycombs, where their hive-mates fan the liquid with their wings to evaporate excess water. This process condenses the sugar and transforms the nectar into honey, which is then stored for future periods of famine when fresh nectar may be scarce.",
                    "About 10,000 years ago, humans discovered that honeybees produce far more honey than is necessary to maintain a hive and that honey can be safely harvested from beehives when they are properly cared for. It was upon this discovery that the first beekeepers were born.",
                    "Our first record of organized beekeeping (also known as apiculture) dates back to ancient Egypt, circa 3,500 BCE. There, honey was commonly used by all classes of people, suggesting that Egyptians mastered beekeeping on a very large scale.",
                    "Egyptians found practical applications for honey, using it as a sweetener in food and as a natural antibiotic in healing salves for wounds. Honey was even used in the mummification process, as many sarcophagi were sealed with wax collected from honey-producing hives and full honeypots were typically offered to the dead as food during the afterlife.",
                    "Honey has been noted in Babylonian and Sumerian writings as far back as 2100 BCE. As the Babylonians began to farm, they also harnessed the power of bees to produce honey for themselves. In Mesopotamia, honey was commonly used in pharmaceuticals and was known for its antiseptic qualities. Ancient Chinese, Arabic, and Egyptian cultures even practiced mellification, a form of bodily preservation using honey.",
                    "When combined with water and yeast, honey turns into alcohol, also known as mead. Mead is believed to be one of the oldest alcohols in the world, with fermented honey dating back between 20,000-40,000 years ago as nomadic people traveled around Africa and the Mediterranean with bees."

Jews still use it during Passover seders as one of the bitter herbs. Some used horseradish syrup as an expectorant cough medicine; others were convinced it cured everything from rheumatism to tuberculosis.",
                    "More recent appreciation of horseradish is believed to have originated in Central Europe, the area also linked to the most widely held theory of how horseradish was named. In German, it’s called “meerrettich” (sea radish) because it grows by the sea. Many believe the English mispronounced the German word “meer” and began calling it “mareradish.” Eventually it became known as horseradish. The word “horse” (as applied in “horseradish”) is believed to denote large size and coarseness. “Radish” comes from the Latin radix meaning root.",
                    "During the Renaissance, horseradish consumption spread from Central Europe northward to Scandinavia and westward to England. It wasn’t until 1640, however, that the British ate horseradish, and then it was consumed only by country folk and laborers. By the late 1600s, horseradish was the standard accompaniment for beef and oysters among all Englishmen.",
                    "The English, in fact, grew the pungent root at inns and coach stations, to make cordials to revive exhausted travelers. Early settlers brought horseradish to North America and began cultivating it in the colonies. It was common in the northeast by 1806, and it grew wild near Boston by 1840.",
                    "Commercial cultivation in America began in the mid 1850s, when immigrants started horseradish farms in the Midwest. By the late 1890s, a thriving horseradish industry had developed in an area of fertile soil on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River.",
                    "Later, smaller centers of horseradish farming sprouted in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. After World War II, homesteaders in the Tulelake region of Northern California began cultivating the root in the west; other areas in the country followed suit. Today, approximately 6 million gallons of prepared horseradish are produced annually in the U.S., enough to generously season enough sandwiches to wrap 12 times around the world."

In the Syrian-Palestinian and Phoenician traditions, cereals were combined with legumes, and used in the form of flour or the various parts of the plant (pods, seeds, leaves). The ancient Greeks used cereals as a nutritious base for their diet, adding legumes, such as the fava bean, lentils, and peas.",

The Citron spread West probably through Persia, where remains of a Citron were found in a 2,500-year-old Persian garden near Jerusalem, and through the Southern Levant (modern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, southern Syria and Cyprus). During the 3rd- and 2nd-centuries BC, it spread to the western Mediterranean.",

However, it does seem that the wealthy Roman elite prized the trees for their decorative appeal in gardens, pleasant odour, healing qualities, symbolic use, and rarity.",

Like the Romans lemon trees were also used as an ornamental plant in early Islamic gardens. Between AD 1000 and 1150 Arab traders distributed the lemon round the Mediterranean region, and the first substantial cultivation of lemons in Europe began in Genoa in the middle of the 15th-century.",

Subsequently, the Spanish conquest throughout the New World helped spread lemon seeds further still.

Historians trace the earliest footprints of mayonnaise to Egyptians and Romans, who used a combination of olive oil and egg as a dietary supplement. However, French chefs are credited for the current-day mayonnaise, which is a thick condiment made from a combination of fat, eggs, vinegar, and seasonings.",
                    "According to culinary historians, mayonnaise was first prepared by a French chef in 1756 as a part of a victory feast for capturing the Port Mahon located on the island of Minorca, Spain. In those days, sauces were prepared by combining cream and eggs. The French chef needed cream to prepare a sauce, but the cream was nowhere to be found. Therefore, he substituted it with olive oil.",
                    "Mayonnaise made its intercontinental journey to America in the 19th century. Initially, mayonnaise was considered a luxury food item and was only served at fancy restaurants such as New York’s Delmonico.",
                    "Richard Hellman, the founder of Hellman’s brand, can be credited for making mayonnaise a common kitchen item and making it accessible and affordable for the masses. As the story goes, in 1912, he opened a deli in New York City. Richard and his wife prepared mayonnaise at home and used it as binding material for mixing different salads. These salads were served at their deli.",
                    "Soon, the mayonnaise overshadowed the salads. In a short time, customers started inquiring Richard about the mayonnaise and whether it was sold separately. Upon realizing the immense popularity and demand for the condiment, the Hellman’s started manufacturing mayonnaise in bulk and selling it off. Their trademark mayonnaise was made with vinegar, sugar, salt, and other spices."

                    "Most mayonnaise consumers believe that commercial mayonnaise spoils quickly if not placed inside a refrigerator. But, this notion is false. Industrial mayonnaise has more preservatives and acidifying agent that increases its shelf life. Moreover, the egg yolks industries use are pasteurized, giving it a longer shelf life.",

It is a spicy mayonnaise with onions and cucumbers while the thousand island dressing is from mayonnaise mixed with pickle relish, variety of herbs, and ketchup. The ranch dressing is a mixture of mayonnaise, minced green onion, and buttermilk."

Mint history identifies the Pilgrims as the people most likely responsible for bringing the herb to the New World according to John Josselyn.

Minthe reveled in Pluto’s attention and even bragged about how much he desired her, but those whispers eventually made their way back to Persephone, Pluto’s wife. She became enraged with jealousy over her husband’s wandering eye. Persephone confronted Minthe and transformed her into a crawling plant to live on earth, cursed to be trampled upon and crushed. Unable to undo the spell, Pluto gave Minthe a sweet aroma that intensified when she was tread on so that she would never go unnoticed and once again fill the air with her enticing presence. The name Minthe eventually evolved into the name of the herb as we know it.",

There are 3 subgroups of Vigna radiata: one is cultivated (Vigna radiata subsp. radiata), and two are wild (Vigna radiata subsp. sublobata and Vigna radiata subsp. glabra).",
                    "The mung bean is a major edible legume seed in Asia (India, South East-Asia and East Asia) and is also eaten in Southern Europe and in the Southern USA. The mature seeds provide an invaluable source of digestible protein for humans in places where meat is lacking or where people are mostly vegetarian.",
                    "The mung bean is thought to have originated from the Indian subcontinent where it was domesticated as early as 1500 BC. Cultivated mung beans were introduced to southern and eastern Asia, Africa, Austronesia, the Americas and the West Indies. It is now widespread throughout the Tropics and is found from sea level up to an altitude of 1850 m in the Himalayas.",

China produces large amounts of mung beans, which represents 19% of its legume production. Thailand is the main exporter and its production increased by 22% per year between 1980 and 2000.",

The southern variant, originating in South Asia before 1068-1077 CE, is characterized by larger seeds, favoring higher yields in regions with scorching climates. In contrast, the northern variant, originating in northern China around 544 CE exhibited drought tolerance and a short vegetative period during the summer planting season.",

Even today, relatively few species of mushrooms can be cultivated compared to the number of edible species.",
                    "Mushrooms were thought to be special and supernatural in origin – 4600 years ago, the Egyptians believed mushrooms to be plants of immortality; the Pharaohs decreed that only they could eat mushrooms. The Romans thought mushrooms were the food of the gods.",

Research in Japan claims that this mushroom has medicinal use – Shiitake was combined with AIDs drugs to boost immune response, combat chronic fatigue and induce antibody formation to Hepatitis B; it also stimulated antitumor activity.",
                    "Different cultures cultivated different species – cultivation of mushrooms in Western cultures was first recorded in Paris, France, around 1650. Agaricus bisporus, the quintessential “shop mushroom”, was first observed growing in melon crop compost. This mushroom was cultivated in open fields for 160 years and then moved underground into caves, excavated tunnels or quarries – this form of cultivation is still used in France today.",
                    "From France, the gardeners of England found Agaricus bisporus a very easy crop to grow which required little labour, investment and space. By 1865, the United States began mushroom cultivation. There are two widely known genetic variants of Agaricus bisporus – these are Portobello and Crimini.",
                    "For the Egyptians, mushrooms were the \"food of the gods.\" They believed that eating them could help them live longer — or even make them immortal. The Greeks drank ergot mushrooms during certain ceremonies and reported seeing visions and ghostly apparitions. The Maya and Aztecs also consumed hallucinogenic mushrooms. Montezuma II, the last ruler of the Aztecs, is said to have eaten copious amounts of \"Teonanacatl\" (flesh of the gods) at his coronation ceremony.",

Mutton and lamb have been considered a choice dish throughout history and carry symbolic value in some religions. Sheep adapt to all kinds of climate and only need grass to eat.",
                    "The animal was soon adopted in Central Asia, Africa and Europe. Sheep played a major economic role in pastoral societies, where people also used the wool and the skin, as well as the milk from the ewes. In America, on the other hand, native species of sheep were never domesticated. Reared sheep arrived there with Christopher Columbus, and were later brought to Australia, towards the end of the 18th century.",

Since then, lamb meat has often been a delicacy served as an expression of welcome. It has featured in banquets and celebrations and on special occasions in people’s lives, such as births, circumcisions and weddings. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, European aristocrats preferred the more expensive mutton and veal to beef."

However most ancient Greeks, like the ancient Romans, did not like oats and used them for feeding to their livestock. They were seen as a weed and of particular annoyance, as wild oats would often compete in cultivated grain fields of barley and wheat.",

This makes the use of oats favorable above other grains (such as wheat), particularly in countries like Ireland, Scotland, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Poland, Germany etc.",

The image was used as Quakers represented “Honesty, Integrity and Purity”, at this time (the late 1800’s) consumers could not always rely on products being unadulterated.",

                    "Okra is a member of the Mallow family, related to cotton, hibiscus and hollyhock. It is a tall (6 ft) annual tropical herb cultivated for its edible green seed pod (there is also a red pod variety, which turns green when cooked).",
                    "Okra is a tropical plant which grows best in warm climates. It is available year-round, with a peak season during the summer months. The pods grow rapidly, being ready for harvest in about 60 days of summer weather, when grown from seed.",
                    "The Igbo word Okuru is the source of the term 'okra.' Nigeria uses the Igbo language. Although the name's history can be traced to West Africa, the vegetable actually originated in East Africa.",
                    "Okra is thought to have been introduced to India by the Bantu tribe, which moved there from Egypt around 2000 BC. They began growing the okra using the seeds they acquired as they travelled from the Eritrean plateau to the valleys of India and China. However, there is no proof that Bhindi was a part of the time's Harappan civilisation. That could indicate that the Moors may have arrived later.",
                    "In the seventh century, Egypt was dominated by the Muslim people of East Africa. It is thought that during this time, okra travelled from Ethiopia to modern-day Saudi Arabia. Additionally, it migrated from Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean and South Asia.",
                    "Because of the outstanding popularity of okra in the French cookery of Louisiana, and its slow gain in popularity elsewhere in this country, it is safe to assume that it was introduced to this country by the French colonists of Louisiana in the early 1700's. It had been introduced to the New World, however, before 1658, reaching Brazil supposedly from Africa. It was known in Surinam in 1686.",
                    "Strangely, records of okra during early American colonial times are lacking, although it must have been common among French colonists. It was being grown as far north as Philadelphia in 1748; Jefferson said it was known in Virginia before 1781, and from about 1800 onward numerous garden writers had something to say about it. Several distinct varieties were known in 1806."

Fossilised remains have been discovered in strata from the Upper Paleolithic at the Relilai snail hatchery in North Africa, and pieces of wild olive trees and stones have been uncovered in excavations of the Chalcolithic period and the Bronze Age in Spain. The existence of the olive tree therefore dates back to the twelfth millennium BC.",
                    "The wild olive tree originated in Asia Minor where it is extremely abundant and grows in thick forests. It appears to have spread from Syria to Greece via Anatolia, although other hypotheses point to lower Egypt, Nubia, Ethiopia, the Atlas Mountains or certain areas of Europe as its source area.",
                    "Caruso for that reason believed it to be indigenous to the entire Mediterranean Basin and considers Asia Minor to have been the birthplace of the cultivated olive some six millennia ago. The Assyrians and Babylonians were the only ancient civilisations in the area who were not familiar with the olive tree.",
                    "Taking the area that extends from the southern Caucasus to the Iranian plateau and the Mediterranean coasts of Syria and Palestine (Acerbo) to be the original home of the olive tree, its cultivation developed considerably in these last two regions, spreading from there to the island of Cyprus and on towards Anatolia or from the island of Crete towards Egypt.",
                    "In the 16th century BC the Phoenicians started disseminating the olive throughout the Greek isles, later introducing it to the Greek mainland between the 14th and 12th centuries BC where its cultivation increased and gained great importance in the 4th century BC when Solon issued decrees regulating olive planting.",
                    "From the 6th century BC onwards, the olive spread throughout the Mediterranean countries reaching Tripoli, Tunis and the island of Sicily. From there, it moved to southern Italy. The Romans continued the expansion of the olive tree to the countries bordering the Mediterranean, using it as a peaceful weapon in their conquests to settle the people. It was introduced in Marseille around 600 BC and spread from there to the whole of Gaul.",
                    "Olive growing was introduced into Spain during the maritime domination of the Phoenicians (1050 BC) but did not develop to a noteworthy extent until the arrival of Scipio (212 BC) and Roman rule (45 BC). After the third Punic War, olives occupied a large stretch of the Baetica valley and spread towards the central and Mediterranean coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula including Portugal.",
                    "With the discovery of America (1492) olive farming spread beyond its Mediterranean confines. The first olive trees were carried from Seville to the West Indies and later to the American Continent. By 1560 olive groves were being cultivated in Mexico, then later in Peru, California, Chile and Argentina, where one of the plants brought over during the Conquest – the old Arauco olive tree – lives to this day."

In fact, Olive Oil trade may have been the source of wealth for this advanced Minoan civilization.",

The Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans are all responsible to some degree for the olive’s introduction into coastal North Africa, Sardinia, Corsica, Marseilles and then the rest of Gaul (present day France), Spain and Portugal.",

As Spanish missionaries marched north, establishing missions in California, they also planted olive groves. Southern California saw the first olive trees, and by the mid-19th century, there was a thriving olive oil industry in California. Today, the California olive oil industry has emerged as a worldwide leader."

The sweet orange, which accounts for 70% of global orange production, is a hybrid of ancient cultivated origin between pomelo (citrus maxima) and mandarin (citrus reticulata).",
                    "Oranges, and all citrus fruits, originated in the Southeast Himalayan foothills, in a region including the eastern area of Assam (India), northern Myanmar and western Yunnan (China).",
                    "A fossil specimen from the late Miocene epoch (11.6 - 5.3 million years ago) from Lincang in Yunnan, China has traits that are characteristic of current major citrus groups, and provides evidence for the existence of a common Citrus ancestor within the Yunnan province approximately 8 million years ago.",
                    "The sour orange (mix of Type 1 Mandarin and Pomelo) was spread by Moors following the Islamic Conquest in the 8th century. At the time, the Arab empire stretched from the borders of China and the Indian subcontinent across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Europe (including Sicily and the Iberian Peninsula).",
                    "The sour orange was not palatable, but was used widely by herbalists to make medicinal syrup. Among the earliest text-based evidence of the sour orange outside Southeast Asia is from 940.",
                    "By the turn of the 11th century, the sour orange had spread through the modern day Arab world to Persia, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, North Africa, and Spain, and subsequently to Sardinia and Sicily in Italy.",
                    "The word ‘orange’ first appeared in the English language in the 12th century. It is thought to have come via the Old French word orenge. It is unclear if orenge derived directly from Persian or Arabic, or if it was calqued from the Italian word used for orange tree, arancio.",
                    "The sweet orange reached Europe through the commercial trade routes established by land and sea. The first written mention of the sweet orange in Europe is in the archives of the Italian city of Savona, recorded in 1471.",
                    "Christopher Columbus took seeds of sweet oranges across to the New World in ‘overseas survival kits’. They were planted on his second voyage, on the island of Hispaniola (Haiti) in 1493, where Columbus founded his first colony. Spanish settlers took the fruit to Florida between 1535 and 1565, and the fruits thrived in the subtropical climate. By 1579, orange trees were growing in St. Augustine - the earliest European Settlement in America."

                    "The word for orange made its way into the English language in the 1300s. However, the name for orange as a color didn’t appear in English until the 1500s. That means the fruit definitely came before the color.",

It is reported that yellow carrots from the Western group mutated into more orange hues that farmers selectively cultivated.",

Centuries later, the Dutch had become a big agricultural force in the world and they were armed with the knowledge that allowed them to propagate the cultivation of orange carrots in large quantities."

However, archaeological evidence shows that most oyster shells from the Mesolithic period are undamaged by rocks or tools; but do show traces of scorch marks consistent with fire. This suggests that the oysters were placed on the embers of a fire or heated stones, and then cooked for a few minutes until the oyster shells popped open.",

Native Oysters were very popular in Roman times. Native Oyster shells are commonly found in Roman archaeological sites, such as villas, towns and forts from the south of England to as far north as Hadrian's Wall. After the Romans left, over time, the oyster lost its status as a delicacy.",

                    "Oysters were a delicacy for the wealthy class during the Greek (13th-9th BCE) and Roman empires (8th BCE-5th AD). Oysters were so important to the Greeks that the Greek became the first to cultivate oysters. This was done by fishermen who would scatter broken pottery pieces where oysters grew to get the oyster babies to attach.",
                    "After the fall of the Greek empire to the Romans, oysters continued to play the same important role. Oysters were still a part of the rich’s extravagant dinners as in Roman mythology as Venus was the Roman counterpart to the Greek God Aphrodite.",
                    "During the Renaissance, oysters were just as popular with the wealthy. The depletion of oysters and the overharvesting were not apparent to the consuming upper class. However, it was for the working class who gathered these oysters as they had to work longer hours to harvest oysters; however, the difficulty in harvesting oysters contributed to new techniques in harvesting oysters at greater lengths and using tide knowledge to be more efficient in harvesting.",

Because oysters were harvested at an unscaled level and became extremely cheap as a result, oysters quickly became very popular on the dining tables of all classes.",

Many historians believe that rice was grown as far back as 5000 years BC. Archaeologists excavating in India discovered rice which could be dated to 4530BC.",
                    "However, the first recorded mention originates from China in 2800 BC. The Chinese emperor, Shen Nung, realised the importance of rice to his people and to honour the grain he established annual rice ceremonies to be held at sowing time, with the emperor scattering the first seeds.",

We are more certain of how rice was introduced to Europe and the Americas, however. For that we have to thank the traveller, whether explorer, soldier, merchant or pilgrim, who took with them the seeds of the crops that grew in their home or foreign lands.",
                    "Not all seeds could be transplanted successfully, however. Great Britain has never been able to cultivate rice due to its unsuitable climatic conditions. The rice plant requires immense quantities of water in its early days, followed by a long and uninterrupted season of hot dry weather. For this reason, farmers must find ways both to flood the fields and drain the water from them at crucial periods. For this reason rice fields must be flat, whereas other cereal crops can grow on undulating ground.",
                    "The paddy field's origin can be traced back to the domestication of rice in the Yangtze River Valley in China around 8,000 years ago. Evidence was discovered by carbon dating rice husks and grains used as pottery. Paddy field farms arrived in South Asia and South East Asia around 2,000 to 3,000 years ago.",
                    "In the West, parts of America and certain regions of Europe, such as Italy and Spain, have the correct climate and access to water, thereby enabling rice cultivation to thrive.

To show his gratitude, the ships captain, James Thurber, presented Henry Woodward with a quantity of rice seed. Some years later, the British unfortunately blotted their copybook in relation to the rice industry they may have initiated. During the American Revolution, they occupied the Charleston area and sent home the entire quantity of harvested rice, failing to leave any seed for the following year's crop.",
                    "The American rice industry survived this set-back and cultivation continued, thanks to President Thomas Jefferson, who broke an Italian law by smuggling rice seed out of Italy during a diplomatic mission in the late 18th Century. The rice industry then transplanted itself from the Carolinas to the southern states surrounding the Mississippi basin."

Also known as the pawpaw, the papaya is a small, fast-growing tropical tree. It probably originated in Mesoamerica (today’s Central America) where wild populations of the plant still occur.",

European colonists introduced the plant to Africa and by the mid-17th century papaya was distributed across the tropics.",

Early civilizations from these regions are thought to have been the first to discover the benefits of papaya, using it for both food and medicine."

                    "Graves of ancient Incas found along the dry western coast of South America often contain jars filled with peanuts and left with the dead to provide food in the afterlife. Tribes in central Brazil also ground peanuts with maize to make an intoxicating beverage for celebrations.",

                    "When Africans were brought to North America as slaves, peanuts came with them. Slaves planted peanuts throughout the southern United States (the word goober comes from the Congo name for peanuts – nguba).",
                    "Records show that peanuts were grown commercially in South Carolina around 1800 and used for oil, food and a substitute for cocoa. However, until 1900 peanuts were not extensively grown, partially because they were regarded as food for the poor, and because growing and harvesting were slow and difficult until labor-saving equipment was invented around the turn of the century.",
                    "Today, peanuts contribute over four billion dollars to the U.S. economy each year. Although the U.S. is a major exporter of edible peanuts to various countries around the world, they are grown in countries as far flung as China, Australia, Argentina and the Continent of Africa."

The only major tree nut that grows naturally in North America, the pecan is considered one of the most valuable North American nut species. The name “pecan” is a Native American word of Algonquin origin that was used to describe “all nuts requiring a stone to crack.”",
                    "Originating in central and eastern North America and the river valleys of Mexico, pecans were widely used by pre-colonial residents. Pecans were favored because they were accessible to waterways, easier to shell than other North American nut species, and of course, for their great taste.",
                    "Because wild pecans were readily available, many Native American tribes in the U.S. and Mexico used the wild pecan as a major food source during autumn. It is speculated that pecans were used to produce a fermented intoxicating drink called “Powcohicora” (where the word “hickory” comes from). It also is said that Native Americans first cultivated the pecan tree.",

These plantings are documented to around 1711—about 60 years before the first recorded planting by U.S. colonists.",

By the late 1700’s, pecans from the northern range reached the English portion of the Atlantic Seaboard and were planted in the gardens of easterners such as George Washington (1775) and Thomas Jefferson (1779). Settlers were also planting pecans in community gardens along the Gulf Coast at this time.",

By 1802, the French were exporting pecans to the West Indies—although it is speculated that pecans were exported to the West Indies and Spain earlier by Spanish colonists in northern Mexico. By 1805, advertisements in London said that the pecan was “…a tree meriting attention as a cultivated crop.”",

The history of medieval Europe throws up further evidence of the influence pepper had in the trading community. Pepper traders even had their own vernacular names i.e., ‘Pepperer’ in England, “Pfeffersacke” in Germany and “Poivrier” in France.",
                    "Pepper cultivation began thousands of years ago in India, where it was native, and it was soon introduced to the major islands of Indonesia by traders. Two species of pepper were domesticated: long pepper (Piper longum) in the northeast of India and black pepper (Piper nigrum) in the southwest.",

Little else is known about how the Egyptians used pepper or the full details of how it got there, but it is known that there was active trade between India and Arabia by that time, and the Egyptians were sending ships down the Nile to what they called the Land of Punt to obtain exotic goods like frankincense, myrrh, and cinnamon.",

Pepper's popularity in Europe rose dramatically in 30 BCE after Rome’s conquest of Egypt, and its use spread rapidly to Roman Gaul (mostly modern-day France and Germany) and Roman Britain.",

                    "The physalis plant, also known as groundcherry or Inca berry, originates from the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru in South America. It reached Europe towards the end of the 18th century and eventually made it to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa in the early 19th century, where it got its nickname “Cape gooseberry” and became a dietary staple.",
                    "While in Europe it is generally cultivated as an annual plant, physalis is actually perennial and can be overwintered easily when kept in a tub indoors. The papery husk that protects the berries is what gives the plant its name “physalis”, which comes from the Greek meaning “bladder”.",
                    "The bitter green plant parts of all physalis species are slightly poisonous and can lead to abdominal cramps, vomiting, and other symptoms of poisoning. Although the physalis berries are edible when ripe, not all of them are enjoyable – like the Physalis alkekengi – so you should always proceed with caution. Unripe berries, however, are poisonous and should not be eaten. They contain alkaloid solanine which can lead to the same poisoning symptoms mentioned above.",
                    "Native to high-altitude, tropical Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, where the fruits grow wild, physalis is casually eaten and occasionally sold in markets. Only recently has the plant become an important crop; it has been widely introduced into cultivation in other tropical, subtropical, and even temperate areas.",
                    "The plant was grown by early settlers of the Cape of Good Hope before 1807. It is not clear whether it was grown there before its introduction to England, but sources since the mid-19th century attribute the common name, Cape gooseberry to this fact. A popular suggestion is that the name properly refers to the calyx surrounding the fruit like a cape. This seems, however, to be an example of folk etymology or false etymology because it does not appear in publications earlier than the mid-20th century."

Like other members of the amaranth family, it has a storied history and an important role as a food staple in many cultures.",
                    "The plant itself is rather unremarkable looking, with dark green, pointed leaves oppositely arranged along a tall stem and inconspicuous green flower clusters. Its designation as a weed lies in the fact that each plant can produce upwards of 100,000 seeds, ensuring many generations per season.",
                    "The Aztecs grew Amaranthus cruentus for both the seeds and the dark-red flowers, which were used ritualistically in ceremonies. The Spanish conquistadors destroyed the fields and banned amaranth production, ostensibly as part their campaign to convert the population to Catholicism. Or perhaps they recognized how important it was as a food source for a formidable opponent.",

                    "First, it has developed a resistance to the common weed-killing pesticide glyphosate (Roundup), which means that it can compete and thrive in our increasingly toxic agricultural fields. Second, pigweed performs a particular type of photosynthesis called C4 carbon fixation. C4 plants are able to more efficiently absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide than C3 plants and are adapted to higher temperatures and drier conditions.",

Throughout the Americas pigweed has decreased in cultural importance but increased in frequency since the Colonial Period.",

                    "Pine nuts are ready to harvest about 10 days before the green cone begins to open. The cones are dried in a burlap bag in the sun for 20 days, to speed up the process of drying and opening. The cones are then smashed (as a way to quickly release the seeds) and the seeds are separated by hand from the cone fragments.",

The fruit followed in its cultivation behind the tomato, corn, potato, and other New World imports. Delicious but challenging and expensive to nurture in chilly climes and irresistible to artists and travelers for its curious structure, the pineapple came to represent many things. For Europeans, it was first a symbol of exoticism, power, and wealth, but it was also an emblem of colonialism, weighted with connections to plantation slavery.",
                    "Originating from the region around the Paraná and Paraguay Rivers (present-day Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina), it was an important economic plant in the development of Indigenous civilizations in the Americas. The Tupi-Guarani and Carib peoples called the fruit, a staple crop, nanas (excellent fruit) and several varieties were grown. As well as food, the pineapple was a source of medicine, fermented to become alcohol, its fibers made into robes and bow strings and thread for cloth.",
                    "From South America, the cultivated pineapple spread to Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Christopher Columbus encountered the pineapple (Ananas comosus, of the extensive bromeliad family) in the West Indies on the island he named Guadeloupe in November 1493.",
                    "This pineapple became a treasured possession in Europe, but it was of practical use for sailors in tropical regions, who were vulnerable to developing scurvy from a lack of vitamin C during long voyages. They observed the healthful effects of eating pineapple, even though the connection between the devastating disease and diet deficiencies was not yet scientifically understood. The Portuguese introduced the fruit (that they called abaxaci) to their colonies in Africa, India, and perhaps other parts of Asia in the mid-sixteenth century. For Tamil-speaking peoples, pineapples were known as annachi pazham.",
                    "The pineapple can be viewed as an early example of a global commodity. And of slavery with the unfathomable number of enslaved Africans brought to the New World. The Dutch had started exporting the fruit to the Netherlands and Surinam, their colony in Guianas. A ship’s captain first managed to transport the plant to the botanical gardens of Amsterdam and Leiden in 1680. Surinam became wealthy in trading humans and was marked by its brutal plantations.",
                    "The pineapple became fashionable in England after the arrival in 1688 of the Dutch King, William III and Queen Mary, daughter of James II, who were keen horticulturalists and, not incidentally, accompanied by skilled gardeners from the Netherlands.",
                    "During the 18th century, the pineapple was established as a symbol of hospitality, with its prickly, tufted shape incorporated in gateposts, door entryways and finials and in silverware and ceramics. The motif continues, prevalent in Christmas decorations in Williamsburg today. But with pride of place on the lavish dining tables of enslavers in North America, the pineapple continued its association with slavery. George Washington, who first encountered the pineapple at the plantations of Barbados, had them imported from the West Indies, a port in the triangular trade of enslaved Africans.",
                    "Returning to the thought of the pineapple as a symbol of globalization, the Spanish had brought the pineapple to Hawaii sometime by the late 18th to early 19th century. The first commercial crop enterprise was established there in 1886 and others soon followed, often settling on land stolen from the Hawaiian people."

                    "Pinto beans are an excellent source of dietary fiber, which is linked to improved blood sugar regulation and gut health, among numerous other benefits. One cup (171 grams) of boiled pinto beans provides 40–60% of the DV for women and men, respectively.",
                    "Pinto beans contain many healthy antioxidants, including polyphenols and flavonoids. Pinto beans are particularly rich in kaempferol, a flavonoid associated with impressive health benefits. Many animal and test-tube studies link it to repressed cancer growth.",
                    "Pinto beans may support blood sugar control. Despite their high carb content, they don’t excessively raise blood sugar. Their low glycemic index (GI) means that they’re digested slowly, moderating their blood sugar effects.",
                    "Pinto beans may promote weight loss. They’re rich in both protein and fiber, two nutrients that can help you feel full for longer and keep your appetite at bay.",
                    "Pinto beans provide a healthy dose of complex carbohydrates. There are nearly 30 grams of starch in a single serving of pinto beans. Carbohydrates in the form of starch provide the body with quick energy. Pinto beans are also a good source of fiber (15 grams per cup). Fiber helps to stabilize blood sugar, boost satiety, and improve digestive health. Pinto beans provide less than 1 gram of naturally occurring sugar.",
                    "Each serving of pinto beans provides a substantial 15 grams of protein. For this reason, many vegans and vegetarians use pinto beans or other types of legumes to boost their protein intake.",

You'll get 74% of your daily recommended intake of folate (294mcg) if you consume one cup of pinto beans and you follow a 2,000-calorie per day diet. Folate, a B vitamin, helps boost red blood cell production and provides other health benefits. You'll also get 36% (251mg) of your recommended daily intake (RDI) of phosphorus, and 33% (0.8mg) of your recommended intake of manganese, a vitamin that boosts nervous system and brain health."

                    "The original homelands of the pistachio were Asia Minor (now Turkey), Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and a bit north to the Caucasus in southern Russia and Afghanistan. Archeologists found evidence of pistachios in a dig site at Jerome, near northeastern Iraq, from as early as 6750 BC. The hanging gardens of Babylon were said to have contained pistachio trees during the reign of King Merodach-Baladan about 700 BC.",
                    "Pistachios are one of only two nuts mentioned in the Old Testament, that is thought to have been assembled in the 5th Century BC. Pistachios are believed to have been one of the foods Adam brought to earth and grew in the Garden of Eden.",
                    "Legend has it that the Queen of Sheba decreed pistachios an exclusively royal food, going so far as to forbid commoners from growing the nut for personal use. Nebuchadnezzar, the ancient king of Babylon, had pistachio trees planted in his fabled hanging gardens. And in the first century A.D., the Emperor Vitellius debuted this prized nut in his capital city of Rome.",
                    "The nuts traveled from Syria to Italy in the first century AD and spread throughout the Mediterranean from there. The Persians used the pistachio abundantly, not only for desserts, but also in ground-up form to thicken and enhance sauces. The Arabs learned a few culinary secrets from the Persians and included pistachios in their dessert delicacies such as Baklava.",
                    "Alongside the Crusades, the Levant trade in the Middle Ages was also widespread. The Venetian Republic had close trade ties with Syria, one of the main cultivation areas for the pistachio. The goods reached northern and central Italy via the sea trade routes. North of the Alps, the pistachio remained unknown for a long time. Upon reaching central Europe, it was called the “Latin Penny Nut” because of its introduction from the Italian sales route, over the Alpine passes.",
                    "By the time pistachios were imported into Europe on a regular basis, they were quite expensive and not everyone could afford them. However, despite their high cost, merchants of France had an ample supply for anyone willing to splurge on the green wonders. While the pistachio was used early on, in various ways for cooking in Italy, north of the Alps it was used primarily as an expensive addition to baked goods.",
                    "During the 1880s, imported pistachios were popular in the USA, especially with Middle Eastern immigrants. California encountered the pistachio in 1854 when Charles Mason, a seed distributor for experimental plantings, brought the pistachio to this country. Several years later, in 1875, a few small pistachio trees imported from France were planted in Sonoma, California. In the early 1900’s Chico, California, became the home of the first experimental Plant Production Station.",
                    "Today, the states of California, Arizona and New Mexico represent 100 percent of the U.S. commercial pistachio production. California comprises 99 percent of the total, with over 312,000 acres planted throughout 22 counties. There are 950 producers in the United States, and the annual “farm gate value” of pistachios represents more than $1.6 billion to the California economy and more than $16 million to the states of Arizona and New Mexico."

It has been widely cultivated throughout India and drier parts of southeast Asia, Malaya, the East Indies and tropical Africa. The most important growing regions are Egypt, China, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Iraq, India, Burma and Saudi Arabia.

                    "Among those drawn to the golden West was Louis Pellier, a Frenchman from the Agen region, which happened to be famous for its “Pruneaux d’Ente,” or prunes. In 1850, Pellier turned a tract of rich topsoil near Mission San Jose into “Pellier’s Gardens,” where, with the help of his brother, Pierre, he grafted a choice cutting of the d’Agen rootstock onto wild plum trees growing in the valley. In a few years, the special trees began to bear a special fruit: California Prunes.",
                    "A prune is a dried plum of any cultivar, mostly the European plum (Prunus domestica). More than 1,000 plum cultivars are grown worldwide for drying; an additional 1,000 or so are grown for plum fruit (different cultivars are created to do better in particular environments). The Greeks and Romans were very fond of both variations of the fruit. Wild plums originated in China and were cultivated from sour plums into sweet fruit.",
                    "Plums came to the Middle East along the Silk Road, and plum trees flourished all over the Mediterranean basin. The plums were dried in the sun or in bakers’ ovens, transforming them into prunes. Because they are highly nutritious and have a long shelf life, prunes and other dried fruits were ideal for travelers, and to store in case of poor harvests.",
                    "The Romans planted the first variety of plum in Gaul near the town of Agen, which is still famous for its delicious prunes. In the 12th century, Benedictine monks returning from the Third Crusade brought new varieties of plums from Syria and grated them onto the local rootstock to create new varieties. Known as Pruneaux d’Ente (grafted prunes), this was the prune that made its way to California, in 1850. It was brought by a man from the Agen area, who grafted it onto local wild plum trees."

The development is credited with saving generations of people from malnutrition and helping facilitate the repopulation of Europe after the Black Plague pandemic of the late 1340s.",
                    "Over time, the United States has seen much of its own rich tradition of eating pulses replaced by a preference for fast food and microwavable meals. Fortunately, Americans are starting to rediscover these overlooked ingredients. Nutritionists have, for example, begun pointing to the pulse rich diets of the Mediterranean as one possible route to improved health.",

The genus name, Raphanus, is a Latinized form of a Greek expression raphanos which means “easily reared”.",

In China some large radishes are grown for the oil in the seeds. In India, the rat-tailed radish is grown for its fleshy edible seed pods which reach a length of 8-12 inches, and in Egypt, one type of radish is grown for its top greens only."

                    "It's said that raisins were discovered when humans stumbled into some grapes drying on a vine. History books record that raisins were sun--dried from grapes as long ago as 1490 B.C. Several hundred years passed before it was determined which variety of grape would make the best raisin.",
                    "Sometime between 120 and 900 B.C., practical ways were developed to grow grapes to become raisins. During that time, Phoenicians started vineyards in Greece and southern Spain, and Armenians created vineyards in Persia, now Turkey, Iran and Iraq. These areas not only had ideal climates for growing the fruit, they were also close to the first commercial markets for raisins, Greece and Rome.",
                    "The raisin became a favorite fruit of the Greeks and Romans, who used them for everything, from adorning their places of worship, to honoring winners of sporting contests. Roman doctors prescribed raisins to cure anything from mushroom poisoning to old age.",

Spain's Queen Isabella sent missionaries to Mexico to teach natives about religion. Among the things the missionaries passed on to the people was their knowledge of grapes, viticulture.",
                    "Moving into California, the missionaries found excellent growing conditions and a long, hot growing season in the San Joaquin Valley. Although only 10 inches of rain falls on this area each year, an extensive irrigation system, constructed over a century ago, brings water from the Sierra Nevada, creating one of the most fertile valleys in the world.",

Most of the grapes dried on the vine before farmers could pick them. Not willing to throw his crop away, one farmer took his raisins to San Francisco, where he found a grocer who agreed to sell the fruit, which was unfamiliar to many customers. Raisins soon became popular enough that a sizable market was created."

There are many varieties of chickens, and one of the most unique, beautiful, and friendly is the silkie chicken. It is because of these qualities that silkie chickens are an excellent pet choice for novice and seasoned chicken owners alike.",

Silkies are also unique because of their dark blue flesh and bones, blue earlobes, five (as opposed to four) toes on each foot, and their inability to fly. It is quite difficult to tell the difference between male and female silkie chicks because they take longer to mature than most other chicken breeds; however, once they are mature, males (roosters) and females (hens) do have some distinct differences including: roosters tend to be larger than hens, the comb will be larger on a male than on a female, and males will crow while females will lay eggs.",

                    "At the end of the 1500's the musky strawberry (Fragaria moschata) was also being cultivated in European gardens. Then, in the 1600’s, the Virginia strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) of North America reached Europe.",
                    "The spread of this new relatively hardy species was very gradual and it remained little appreciated until the end of the 1700’s and early 1800's when it was popular in England. At that time, English gardeners worked to raise new varieties from seed and they increased the number of varieties from three to nearly thirty.",
                    "Meanwhile, a French spy brought the Chilean strawberry (Fragaria chiloensis) from Chile to France in 1714. This species of strawberry had a quality the others lacked: size. It had fewer but larger flowers and gave rise to larger fruit. However, the Chilean strawberry was not hardy and was difficult to grow inland, away from mild coastal climates.",
                    "These two New World species of strawberries were crossed in Europe, giving rise to the modern strawberry, Fragaria ananassa. It was the French who first accidentally pollinated the Chilean strawberry with the Virginia strawberry when pistillate Chilean plants were inter-planted with staminate Virginian plants and natural hybrids were made.",
                    "The English did most of the early breeding work to develop the ancestors of the varieties we enjoy today. All modern strawberry varieties have descended from this crossing of Virginia and Chilean strawberries.",
                    "‘Hovey’ was the name of the first American strawberry variety that resulted from a planned cross, and it is an ancestor of most modern varieties. It was developed by Charles Hovey, a nurseryman in Cambridge, MA, in 1834."

                    "Modern bread wheat varieties have forty-two chromosomes and evolved from crosses between emmer and goat grass, which is the source of the unique glutenin genes that give bread dough the ability to form gluten.",
                    "The wheat industry divides the thousands of varieties available today into six wheat classes: hard red winter, hard red spring, soft red winter, durum, hard white, and soft white wheat.",
                    "Spring wheat classes (hard, soft, and durum) are planted in the spring and harvested in the summer. Winter wheat is planted in the fall, grows several inches, and may even be grazed by livestock before the grain head develops.",
                    "Hard wheat classes (spring and winter) contain higher quantities of the proteins needed to produce bread, buns, pasta (durum), pizza crust, and other bread products.",
                    "Soft wheat contains lower quantities of protein than hard wheat, and it is conducive to producing tender cookies, cakes, pastries, crackers, Asian noodles, and steam breads."

Whole wheat bread is made from flour that contains the entire wheat kernel, including the bran and germ. It’s here that wheat packs the most nutrients, such as fiber, iron, and potassium. Leaving the wheat kernel intact makes for a less processed, more nutritious bread.",

A typical slice includes between 12 and 20 gram of total carbs, including a large quantity of fibre (3 gram per slice). Some whole wheat breads may have additional carbs from added sweeteners.

Fiber-enriched food, such as whole wheat bread, aids your body in getting rid of waste easier. Aside from that, fiber also helps you overeat less because it makes you feel full.",

This holds up even when adjusting for lifestyle factors, such as BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, eating habits, and physical activity, as long as the individual is consistent with their whole grain consumption and aims for two to three servings per day (60-90 grams).",
                    "In a meta-analysis of 35 studies, comparing high whole grain intake to low whole grain intake, researchers found that individuals who ate the highest amount of whole grains had a decreased risk of certain digestive cancers."
